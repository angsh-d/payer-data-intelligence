 Severe (G3) or life-threatening (G4) immunotherapy-related acute renal failure/elevated serum creatinine; 
severe (G3-4) immunotherapy-related uveitis 
 Life threatening (G4) immunotherapy-related myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, impaired ventricular 
function, or conduction abnormalities 
 Severe immunotherapy-related inflammatory arthritis 
 Moderate, severe, or life-threatening immunotherapy-related, steroid-refractory myalgias or myositis (muscle 
weakness) 
and 
o Patient has had inadequate improvement in toxicities or symptoms despite systemic corticosteroid therapy of 
adequate dose and duration for the diagnosis; and 
o One of the following: 
 Patient is receiving infliximab in combination with systemic corticosteroids 
 Patient is intolerant to systemic corticosteroid therapy 
and 
o Initial authorization is for no more than 4 doses 
 For continuation of therapy, all of the following:

There may be other conditions that qualify as serious, rare diseases for which the use of infliximab may be appropriate. 
Refer to the Benefit Considerations section of this policy for additional information.  
 
Infliximab is unproven and not medically necessary for the treatment of: 
 Hidradenitis suppurativa 
 Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (juvenile rheumatoid 
arthritis) 
 Myelodysplastic syndromes 
 Reiter’s syndrome 
 Sjögren’s syndrome  
 Still’s disease 
 Undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy 
 Wegener’s granulomatosis 
 
Infliximab is unproven for the treatment of the above conditions because statistically robust randomized controlled trials 
are needed to address the issue of whether infliximab has sufficient superiority in clinical efficacy compared to other 
available treatments to justify the inherent clinical risk in the use of a monoclonal antibody anti-tumor necrosis factor 
agent.

Background 
 
Infliximab is a genetically engineered chimeric human/mouse monoclonal antibody (cA2) against tumor necrosis factor 
alfa (TNF-alfa), a key mediator of mucosal inflammation. Increased levels of TNF-alfa are found in the intestinal mucosa 
and stool of patients with active Crohn’s disease and in the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Elevated TNF-alfa 
concentrations are also involved in ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis. TNF-
alfa activity is neutralized by cA2 antibody binding to the soluble and transmembrane forms which blocks the binding of 
TNF-alfa with its receptors. Activities inhibited by anti-TNF-alfa antibodies include induction of interleukins, enhancement 
of leukocyte migration, and expression of adhesion molecules. In vitro studies have demonstrated that cells expressing 
transmembrane TNF-alfa bound by infliximab are lysed by complement or effector cells. In animal models, antibodies to 
TNF-alfa were shown to prevent or reduce inflammation.

Benefit Considerations 
 
Some Certificates of Coverage allow for coverage of experimental/investigational/unproven treatments for life-threatening 
illnesses when certain conditions are met. The member specific benefit plan document must be consulted to make 
coverage decisions for this service. Some states mandate benefit coverage for off-label use of medications for some 
diagnoses or under some circumstances when certain conditions are met. Where such mandates apply, they supersede 
language in the benefit document or in the medical or drug policy. 
 
Clinical Evidence 
 
Proven 
Sarcoidosis 
The use of infliximab in patients with chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study.52 Patients must have been treated with at least 10 mg/d of prednisone or equivalent or one 
or more immunosuppressants for ≥ 3 months before screening. They received infliximab 3 mg/kg (n = 46), 5 mg/kg  
(n = 47), or placebo (n = 45) at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24. They were followed through 52 weeks. The primary 
endpoint was the change at week 24 from baseline in percent of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC). Patients receiving 
infliximab 3 or 5 mg/kg had a mean increase of 2.5% compared with no change for those receiving placebo (p = 0.038). 
 
Infliximab has also been studied for use in sarcoidosis in small clinical trials, small published studies, and reports that also 
conclude that clinical evidence supports the use of infliximab for treatment-resistant sarcoidosis.

Noninfectious Uveitis 
Long-term safety and efficacy of treatment with infliximab in uveitis for more than one year in patients (n = 164) with 
Behçet’s disease (BD) was evaluated via questionnaire in a retrospective multicenter study.12 Primary outcome measures 
assessed were best-corrected VA (BCVA) determined by the Landolt ring, proportion of subjects without relapse of 
uveitis, frequency of ocular inflammatory attacks per year, and adverse effects of the therapy. The mean age at initiation 
of infliximab treatment was 42.6 ±11.7 years, and the mean treatment duration was 32.9 ±14.4 months. Data before and 
at the last visit during infliximab treatment were analyzed in 4 groups divided by duration of treatment: group A (n = 43, 
12-< 24 months), group B (n = 62, 24-< 36 months), group C (n = 42, 36-< 48 months), and group D (n = 17, ≥ 48 
months). The frequency of ocular attacks decreased in all groups (from 5.3 ±3.0 to 1.0 ±0.3 in group A, 4.8 ±4.6 to 1.4 
±0.3 in group B, 4.1 ±2.9 to 0.9 ±0.3 in group C, and 9.5 ±5.8 to 1.6 ±0.5 in group D; all p < 0.05). The BCVA was 
improved in approximately 55% of the eyes after treatment. Mean BCVA was improved after treatment with infliximab in 
groups A to C (from 0.79 ±1.04 to 0.59 ±0.94 in group A, 0.59 ±1.07 to 0.41 ±1.04 in group B, and 1.15 ±1.77 to 0.92 
±1.73 in group C; all p < 0.05) but not in group D. Uveitis relapsed in 59.1% of all patients after infliximab treatment, and 
no difference in duration until relapse was observed between individual groups. Approximately 80% of relapses occurred 
within one year after the initiation of infliximab treatment in all groups, 90% of which were controlled by increasing doses 
of topical corticosteroids and shortening the interval of infliximab infusion. Adverse effects were observed in 65 cases or 
35% of all subjects. Infliximab treatment was continued in 85% of the patients, but 15% of the patients discontinued 
infliximab treatment because of adverse effects or insufficient efficacy. Researchers concluded that this study 
demonstrated that infliximab reduced the frequency of ocular attacks and improved VA inpatients with BD-related uveitis 
refractory to conventional therapies and was generally well tolerated, with few serious adverse events. 
 
Kruh et al conducted a retrospective, interventional, non-comparative cohort study which evaluated the safety and efficacy 
of infliximab for the treatment of refractory noninfectious uveitis. Patients (n = 88) with chronic, recalcitrant uveitis treated 
with infliximab were identified through an electronic medical record database.
13 All charts were reviewed for sex, 
diagnosis, location of inflammation, presence of vasculitis, prior immunomodulatory treatments, duration of infliximab 
treatment, dose received, secondary side effects, and other medications continued while receiving treatment with 
infliximab. The primary outcome measures assessed were the rate of remission, time to remission, relapse rate, failure 
rate, and patient tolerance. Additional analysis was aimed to identity risk factors that would predict a higher success rate 
of infliximab to treat various types of noninfectious uveitis. Of the 72 patients (81.8%) who achieved clinical remission 
while being treated with infliximab, 42 (58.3%) required additional immunomodulatory medications. At 7, 18.1, and 44.7 
weeks, 25%, 50%, and 75% of patients, respectively, achieved clinical remission off all corticosteroids. Thirty-two patients 
(36.4%) experienced at least one side effect while on infliximab therapy, and 17 patients (19.3%) discontinued treatment 
secondary to one or more intolerable side effects. The most common adverse effects were skin rash (9.1%) and fatigue 
(8%). Factors associated with a higher chance to achieve clinical remission were non-idiopathic uveitis (p < 0.001), 
intermediate or panuveitis (p < 0.001), absence of vasculitis (p < 0.001), and a starting dose ≥ 5 mg/kg (p < 0.011).

Researchers concluded that infliximab treatment induced a high rate of complete clinical remission in recalcitrant uveitis 
and is well tolerated by most patients. 
 
NCCN Recommended Uses 
According to the NCCN Drugs & Biologics Compendium, NCCN recommends (2A) infliximab for the treatment of: 
 Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as additional therapy in conjunction with systemic corticosteroids following 
no response (steroid-refractory disease) to first-line therapy options. 
o Therapy for steroid-refractory acute GVHD is often used in conjunction with the original immunosuppressive 
agent. 
 Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities - Consider adding infliximab for the management of immunotherapy-
related: 
o Myocarditis as a further intervention if no improvement within 24-48 hours of starting pulse-dose 
methylprednisolone. 
o Moderate (G2) and strongly consider for severe (G3-4) diarrhea or colitis if no response after 2 days of systemic 
corticosteroids. 
o Moderate (G2) pneumonitis if no improvement after 2 to 3 days of corticosteroids or severe (G3-4) pneumonitis if 
no improvement after 2 days of systemic corticosteroids. 
o Severe (G3) or life-threatening (G4) acute renal failure/elevated serum creatinine if toxicity remains > G2 after 4-6 
weeks of systemic corticosteroids. 
o G1-4 uveitis that is refractory to high-dose systemic corticosteroids. 
o Severe inflammatory arthritis as additional disease modifying anti-rheumatic therapy if symptoms do not improve 
after 7 days of starting high-dose corticosteroids or if unable to taper corticosteroids by week 2. 
o Moderate, severe, or life-threatening steroid-refractory myalgias or myositis if refractory to steroids. 
 
Unproven 
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis) 
In an international, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, 122 children with polyarticular juvenile 
rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and persistent symptoms despite at least 3 months prior MTX were randomized to receive 
infliximab 3 mg/kg + MTX or placebo + MTX at weeks 0, 2, and 6.24 At week 14, the placebo group was switched to 
infliximab 6 mg/kg + placebo. Responses were measured according to American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 30 
(Pedi 30) criteria. Although a higher percentage of patients in the 3 mg/kg group achieved responses at week 14 (63.8% 
vs. 49.2% in placebo group), the study failed to show the efficacy of infliximab for JRA as the difference was not 
statistically significant. By week 16, similar percentage response was achieved in both groups. At week 52, the 
percentages reaching ACR Pedi 50 and ACR Pedi 70 were 69.6% and 51.8%, respectively. The safety profile of infliximab 
3 mg/kg was generally less favorable than that of infliximab 6 mg/kg, with more serious adverse events, infusion 
reactions, antibodies to infliximab, and newly induced antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA. 
Patients who completed the study also continued to receive open-label treatment for up to 2 years.  
 
Infliximab has also been studied for use in JIA in smaller, open-label trials.
24,31-34,36,43-45 Further large-scale studies are 
required to characterize the efficacy and safety of infliximab in JIA. 
 
Miscellaneous 
The medical literature contains a number of small open-label studies and case reports of infliximab therapy for the 
treatment of adult-onset Still’s disease26,27, Sjögren’s syndrome22,28, myelodysplastic syndromes37, undifferentiated 
spondyloarthropathy35, Reiter’s syndrome19, hidradenitis suppurativa21,49-51, and Wegener’s granulomatosis.38,47-48 While 
these studies and reports showed infliximab to have a positive effect on the manifestations of these diseases, the use of 
infliximab for these conditions has not been evaluated in large, controlled trials. 
 
 
Professional Societies 
Ulcerative Colitis 
In 2020, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) published a clinical practice guideline on the management 
of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. In regard to infliximab, the guidelines recommend: 
 In adult outpatients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis, the AGA recommends using infliximab, adalimumab, 
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib or ustekinumab over no treatment. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality 
evidence). 
 In adult outpatients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis who are naïve to biologic agents, the AGA suggests using 
infliximab or vedolizumab rather than adalimumab, for induction of remission. (Conditional recommendation, moderate 
quality evidence).

 In adult outpatients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis who have previously been exposed to infliximab, 
particularly those with primary non-response, the AGA suggests using ustekinumab or tofacitinib, rather than 
vedolizumab or adalimumab for induction of remission. (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence). 
 In adult outpatients with active moderate-severe ulcerative colitis, the AGA suggests using biologic monotherapy 
(TNFα antagonists, vedolizumab, ustekinumab) rather than thiopurine monotherapy for induction of remission. 
(Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence). 
 In adult outpatients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis in remission, the AGA makes no recommendation in favor 
of, or against, using biologic monotherapy (TNFα antagonists, vedolizumab or ustekinumab), rather than thiopurine 
monotherapy for maintenance of remission. (No recommendation, knowledge gap). 
 In adult outpatients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis, the AGA suggests combining TNFα antagonists, 
vedolizumab or ustekinumab with thiopurines or methotrexate, rather than biologic monotherapy. (Conditional 
recommendation, low quality evidence). 
 In adult outpatients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis, the AGA suggests combining TNFα antagonists, 
vedolizumab or ustekinumab with thiopurines or methotrexate, rather than thiopurine monotherapy. (Conditional 
recommendation, low quality evidence). 
 In adult outpatients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis, the AGA suggests early use of biologic agents with or 
without immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step up after failure of 5-aminosalicylates. (Conditional 
recommendation, very low-quality evidence). 
 In adult outpatients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis who have achieved remission with biologic agents and/or 
immunomodulators, or tofacitinib, the AGA suggests against continuing 5-aminosalicylates for induction and 
maintenance of remission. (Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). 
 In hospitalized adult patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis refractory to intravenous corticosteroids, the AGA 
suggests using infliximab or cyclosporine. (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence). 
 In hospitalized adult patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis, refractory to intravenous corticosteroids, being 
treated with infliximab, the AGA makes no recommendation on routine use of intensive vs. standard infliximab dosing. 
(No recommendation, knowledge gap). 
 
The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) published their guidelines for the management of adults with ulcerative 
colitis in 2019. In regard to infliximab or anti-TNF therapy, the guidelines recommend: 
Summary and strength of graded recommendations for the management of ulcerative colitis 
 Induction of remission in moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: 
o In patients with moderately to severely active UC, the ACG recommends anti-TNF therapy using adalimumab, 
golimumab, or infliximab for induction of remission (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). 
o In patients with moderately to severely active UC who have failed 5-ASA therapy and in whom anti-TNF therapy is 
used for induction of remission, the ACG suggests against using 5-ASA for added clinical efficacy (conditional 
recommendation, low quality of evidence). 
o When infliximab is used as induction therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC, the ACG 
recommends combination therapy with a thiopurine (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence for 
azathioprine). 
o In patients with moderately to severely active UC who are responders to anti-TNF therapy and now losing 
response, the ACG suggests measuring serum drug levels and antibodies (if there is not a therapeutic level) to 
assess the reason for loss of response (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). 
 Maintenance of remission in patients with previously moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: 
o In patients with previously moderately to severely active UC who have achieved remission but previously failed 5-
ASA therapy and are now on anti-TNF therapy, the ACG recommends against using concomitant 5-ASA for 
efficacy of maintenance of remission (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). 
o The ACG recommends continuing anti-TNF therapy using adalimumab, golimumab, or infliximab to maintain 
remission after anti-TNF induction in patients with previously moderately to severely active UC (strong 
recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 
 Management of the hospitalized patient with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC): 
o In patients with ASUC failing to adequately respond to intravenous corticosteroids by 3–5 days the ACG 
recommends medical rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine (strong recommendation, moderate quality of 
evidence). 
o In patients with ASUC who achieve remission with infliximab treatment, the ACG recommends maintenance of 
remission with the same agent (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 
 
Summary of key concept statements for the management of ulcerative colitis

o Robust data on combination anti-TNF and immunomodulator therapy in moderately to severely active UC exist 
only for infliximab and thiopurines. 
o Patients who are primary nonresponders to an anti-TNF (defined as lack of therapeutic benefit after induction 
despite adequate drug levels) should be evaluated and considered for alternative mechanisms of disease control 
(e.g., in a different class of therapy) rather than cycling to another drug within the anti-TNF class. 
o In patients with moderately to severely active UC who had an initial response but subsequently lost efficacy to 
one anti-TNF therapy, the ACG recommends alternative anti-TNF therapy (but not the biosimilar to the original 
brand) compared with no treatment for induction of remission. 
 
Plaque Psoriasis 
In 2019, the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation published updated treatment 
guidelines for the management and treatment of psoriasis with biologic therapies. In regard to ustekinumab, the guidelines 
state: 
 Infliximab is recommended as a monotherapy treatment option in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis. 
 The recommended starting dose of infliximab is an infusion of 5 mg/kg administered at week 0, week 2, and week 6, 
and thereafter it is administered every 8 weeks. 
 Infliximab is recommended to be administered at a more frequent interval (less than every 8 weeks and as frequently 
as every 4 weeks during the maintenance phase) and/or at a higher dose up to 10 mg/kg for better disease control in 
some adult patients. 
 Infliximab can be recommended as a monotherapy treatment option in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis affecting the palms and soles (plaque-type palmoplantar psoriasis). 
 Infliximab can be recommended as a monotherapy treatment option in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis affecting the nails. 
 Infliximab can be recommended as a monotherapy treatment option in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis affecting the scalp. 
 Infliximab may be recommended as a monotherapy treatment option in adult patients with other subtypes (pustular or 
erythrodermic) of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. 
 Infliximab is recommended as a monotherapy treatment option in adult patients with plaque psoriasis of any severity 
when associated with significant psoriatic arthritis. Infliximab also inhibits radiographically detected damage of joints in 
patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
 Combination of infliximab and topicals such as high-potency corticosteroids with or without a vitamin D analogue can 
be recommended as a treatment option to augment efficacy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis 
in adults. 
 Infliximab may be combined with acitretin to augment efficacy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis in adults. 
 Infliximab may be combined with methotrexate to possibly augment efficacy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe 
plaque psoriasis in adults. 
 Infliximab may be combined with apremilast to augment efficacy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis in adults when clinically indicated. 
 
Psoriatic Arthritis  
In 2018, the American College of Rheumatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation published treatment guidelines for 
the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. In regard to psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and TNFi’s, the guidelines state: 
 Recommendations for the initial treatment of patients with active psoriatic arthritis who are oral small molecule (OSM)-
and other treatment–naïve patients: 
o Treat with a TNFi biologic over an OSM. 
 Conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence; may consider an OSM if the patient does not 
have severe PsA, does not have severe psoriasis,§ prefers oral therapy, has concern over starting a biologic 
as the first therapy, or has contraindications to TNFi biologics, including congestive heart failure, previous 
serious infections, recurrent infections, or demyelinating disease. 
o Treat with a TNFi biologic over an IL-17i biologic. 
 Conditional recommendation based on very-low-quality evidence; may consider an IL-17i biologic if the 
patient has severe psoriasis or has contraindications to TNFi biologics, including congestive heart failure, 
previous serious infections, recurrent infections, or demyelinating disease. 
o Treat with a TNFi biologic over an IL-12/23i biologic. 
 Conditional recommendation based on very-low-quality evidence; may consider an IL-12/23i biologic if the 
patient has severe psoriasis, prefers less frequent drug administration, or has contraindications to TNFi

biologics, including congestive heart failure, previous serious infections, recurrent infections, or demyelinating 
disease. 
 Recommendations for treatment of patients with active psoriatic arthritis despite treatment with an OSM: 
o Switch to a TNFi biologic over a different OSM. 
 Conditional recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence; may consider switching to a different OSM 
if the patient has contraindications to TNFi biologics, including congestive heart failure, previous serious 
infections, recurrent infections, or demyelinating disease, if the patient prefers an oral versus parenteral 
therapy, or in patients without evidence of severe PsA or severe psoriasis. 
o Switch to a TNFi biologic over an IL-17i biologic. 
 Conditional recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence; may consider an IL-17i if the patient has 
severe psoriasis and/or has contraindications to TNFi biologics, including congestive heart failure, previous 
serious infections, recurrent infections, or demyelinating disease, and/or a family history of demyelinating 
disease such as multiple sclerosis. 
o Switch to a TNFi biologic over an IL-12/23i biologic. 
 Conditional recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence; may consider an IL-12/23i if the patient 
has severe psoriasis and/or contraindications to TNFi biologics, including congestive heart failure, previous 
serious infections, recurrent infections, or demyelinating disease, or prefers less frequent drug administration. 
o Switch to a TNFi biologic over abatacept. 
 Conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence; may consider abatacept if the patient has 
contraindications to TNFi biologics, including congestive heart failure, previous serious infections, recurrent 
infections, or demyelinating disease. 
o Switch to a TNFi biologic over tofacitinib. 
 Conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence; may consider tofacitinib if the patient has 
contraindications to TNFi biologics, including congestive heart failure, previous serious infections, recurrent 
infections, or demyelinating disease, or prefers oral medication. 
o Switch to a TNFi biologic monotherapy over MTX and a TNFi biologic combination therapy. 
 Conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence; may consider MTX and TNFi biologic 
combination therapy if the patient has severe skin manifestations, has had a partial response to current MTX 
therapy, has concomitant uveitis (since uveitis may respond to MTX therapy), and if the current TNFi biologic 
is infliximab or adalimumab. 
 Recommendations for treatment of patients with active psoriatic arthritis despite treatment with a TNFi biologic, as 
monotherapy or in combination with MTX: 
o Switch to a different TNFi biologic over switching to an IL-17i biologic. 
 Conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence; may consider an IL-17i if the patient had a 
primary TNFi biologic efficacy failure or a TNFi biologic–associated serious adverse event or severe psoriasis. 
o Switch to a different TNFi biologic over switching to an IL-12/23i biologic. 
 Conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence; may consider an IL-12/23i if the patient had a 
primary TNFi biologic efficacy failure or a TNFi biologic–associated serious adverse effect or prefers less 
frequent drug administration. 
o Switch to a different TNFi biologic over switching to abatacept. 
 Conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence; may consider abatacept if the patient had a 
primary TNFi biologic efficacy failure or TNFi biologic–associated serious adverse effect. 
o Switch to a different TNFi biologic over switching to tofacitinib. 
 Conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence; may consider tofacitinib if the patient prefers an 
oral therapy or had a primary TNFi biologic efficacy failure or a TNFi biologic–associated serious adverse 
effect. 
o Switch to a different TNFi biologic (with or without MTX) over adding MTX to the same TNFi biologic 
monotherapy. 
 Conditional recommendation based on very-low-quality evidence; may consider adding MTX when patients 
have demonstrated partial response to the current TNFi biologic therapy, especially if the TNFi biologic is a 
monoclonal antibody. 
o Switch to a different TNFi biologic monotherapy over switching to a different TNFi biologic and MTX combination 
therapy. 
 Conditional recommendation based on very-low-quality evidence; may consider switching to a TNFi biologic 
and MTX combination therapy if the current TNFi biologic is infliximab. 
 In adult patients with active PsA despite treatment with a TNFi biologic and MTX combination therapy: 
o Switch to a different TNFi biologic + MTX over switching to a different TNFi biologic monotherapy. 
 Conditional recommendation based on very-low-quality evidence; may consider switching to a different TNFi 
biologic monotherapy if the patient has demonstrated MTX-associated adverse events, prefers to receive 
fewer medications, or perceives MTX as a burden.

Ankylosing Spondylitis 
In 2017, the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and the British Health Professionals in Rheumatology published a 
revision to their 2005 BSR guidelines to provide guidance for clinicians in the United Kingdom prescribing biologic drugs 
for the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including ankylosing spondylitis. This includes the criteria for starting 
treatment, choice of drug, and assessing response. In regard to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), the guidelines 
recommend: 
 The effectiveness of biologics in axSpA: 
o Anti-TNF therapy is effective at reducing disease activity and spinal pain in axSpA. While short-term MRI data 
support the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy in treating inflammatory SIJ and spinal lesions in axSpA, evidence for 
anti-TNF therapy on radiographic disease progression is currently limited. 
o Currently there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of other biologic agents in axSpA. 
 Initiating treatment: 
o Patients should be considered for anti-TNF therapy if they have active axSpA. 
 Choice of Drug: 
o Extra-articular manifestations and patient choice should be considered when selecting an anti-TNF agent. In the 
absence of head-to-head studies, systematic reviews have shown no statistical difference in efficacy between 
infliximab, golimumab, etanercept and adalimumab in the treatment of AS (certolizumab data were not included in 
these comparative reviews, but its efficacy has been established in clinical trials). 
o There are insufficient data to comment on relative efficacy in nr-axSpA. However, not all biologics are licensed for 
or effective in the treatment of extra-articular disease, so drug choice should take into account co-morbidities and 
the preferred route and frequency of administration. 
 Assessing Response: 
o Initial efficacy response should be assessed following 3–6 months of therapy and responders should then be 
reassessed every 6 months. 
 Withdrawal of Therapy: 
o In the absence of an initial clinical response by 6 months, or failure to maintain response at two consecutive 
assessments, withdrawal of that anti-TNF agent should be considered. 
o There is no evidence to support the withdrawal of anti-TNF therapy in treatment responders. 
 Switching: 
o In the event of anti-TNF failure due to inefficacy or adverse events, an alternative anti-TNF agent should be 
offered if clinically appropriate. 
 Safety: 
o The safety of anti-TNF therapies in axSpA is comparable to other inflammatory joint diseases such as RA. There 
is little evidence to suggest that safety issues differ hugely with different disease groups, and the 2010 British 
Society for Rheumatology (BSR) guidelines on the safety of anti-TNF therapies in RA are applicable in axSpA. 
 
In 2016, the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) and European League Against Rheumatism 
(EULAR) updated and integrated the recommendations for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and the recommendations for the 
use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) into one guideline applicable to the full 
spectrum of patients with axSpA. The recommendations describe all aspects of the management of patients with a 
diagnosis of axSpA. The recommendations related to biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) are: 
 bDMARDs should be considered in patients with persistently high disease activity despite conventional treatments 
(e.g., non-biologic DMARDs); current practice is to start with TNFi therapy. 
 If TNFi therapy fails, switching to another TNFi or IL-17i therapy should be considered. 
 If a patient is in sustained remission, tapering of a bDMARD can be considered. 
 
In 2019, the American College of Rheumatology/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and 
Treatment Network published an update of their recommendations for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and 
nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis.
77 The recommendations related to bDMARDs are:  
• TNFi are recommended over secukinumab or ixekizumab as the first biologic to be used. 
• Secukinumab or ixekizumab is recommended over the use of a second TNFi in patients with primary nonresponse to 
the first TNFi. 
• TNFi, secukinumab, and ixekizumab are favored over tofacitinib. 
• Co-administration of low-dose methotrexate with TNFi is not recommended, nor is a strict treat-to-target strategy or 
discontinuation or tapering of biologics in patients with stable disease. 
• Sulfasalazine is recommended only for persistent peripheral arthritis when TNFi are contraindicated. 
• For patients with unclear disease activity, spine or pelvis magnetic resonance imaging could aid assessment. 
• Routine monitoring of radiographic changes with serial spine radiographs is not recommended.

Crohn’s Disease 
According to the American College of Gastroenterology Practice Guidelines for the Management of Crohn’s Disease in 
Adults (ACG Practice Guidelines) published in February 2009, patients with moderate-severe disease usually have a 
Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of 220-450. They have failed to respond to treatment for mild-moderate disease, or 
have more prominent symptoms of fever, significant weight loss, abdominal pain or tenderness, intermittent nausea, or 
vomiting (without obstructive findings), or significant anemia.3  
 
The CDAI52 is the sum of the following clinical or laboratory variables after multiplying by their weighting factor given in 
parentheses: 
 Number of liquid or soft stools each day for seven days (2). 
 Abdominal pain graded from 0-3 in severity each day for seven days (5). 
 General well-being, subjectively assessed from 0 (well) to 4 (terrible) each day for seven days (7). 
 Presence of complications where 1 point is added for each complication (20). Complications include: 
o The presence of joint pains (arthralgia) or frank arthritis. 
o Inflammation of the iris or uveitis.  
o Presence of erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, or aphthous ulcers.  
o Anal fissures, fistulae, or abscesses.  
o Other fistulae (e.g., enterocutaneous, vesicle, vaginal). 
o Fever (> 37.8° C) during the previous week. 
 Taking diphenoxylate/atropine (Lomotil®) or opiates for diarrhea (30). 
 Presence of an abdominal mass where 0 = none, 2 = questionable, 5 = definite (10). 
 Absolute deviation of hematocrit from 47% in males and 42% in females (6). 
 Percentage deviation from standard body weight (1). 
 
The 2018 ACG Practice Guidelines support the use of infliximab for treatment and maintenance of patients with moderate 
to severely active Crohn’s disease which is resistant or refractory to corticosteroids, thiopurines or methotrexate In 
addition, they state anti-TNF agents can be considered to treat severely active Crohn’s disease.
64 
 
Rheumatoid Arthritis 
The 2015 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) RA treatment guideline addresses the use of DMARDS, biologics, 
tofacitinib, and glucocorticoids in early (< 6 months) and established (≥ 6 months) RA and the use of various treatment 
approaches in frequently encountered clinical scenarios, including treat-to-target, switching between therapies, tapering of 
therapy, the use of biologics and DMARDs in high-risk RA patients, vaccination in patients with RA receiving DMARDs or 
biologics, TB screening with biologics or tofacitinib, and laboratory monitoring with DMARDs.
2 The guideline 
recommendations apply to common clinical situations, since the panel considered issues common to most patients, not 
exceptions. Recommendations are classified as either strong or conditional. A strong recommendation means that the 
panel was confident that the desirable effects of following the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects (or vice 
versa), so the course of action would apply to most patients, and only a small proportion would not want to follow the 
recommendation. A conditional recommendation means that the desirable effects of following the recommendation 
probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of patients, but some may 
not want to follow the recommendation. As a result, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and warrant a 
shared decision-making approach. 
 
Supplementary Appendix 5, of the 2015 ACR RA guideline, summarizes recommendations for patients with early RA, 
established RA, and high-risk comorbidities:
2 
 
Recommendations for Early RA Patients 
 The panel strongly recommends using a treat-to-target strategy rather than a non-targeted approach, regardless of 
disease activity level. The ideal target should be low disease activity or remission, as determined by the clinician and 
the patient. In some cases, another target may be chosen because risk tolerance by patients or comorbidities may 
mitigate the usual choices. 
 For DMARD-naïve patients with early, symptomatic RA, the panel strongly recommends DMARD monotherapy over 
double or triple DMARD therapy in patients with low disease activity and conditionally recommends DMARD 
monotherapy over double or triple DMARD therapy in patients with moderate or high disease activity. Methotrexate 
should be the preferred initial therapy for most patients with early RA with active disease. 
 For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite DMARD therapy (with or without glucocorticoids), the panel 
strongly recommends treatment with a combination of DMARDs or a TNFi or a non-TNF biologic, with or without

methotrexate (MTX) in no particular order of preference, rather than continuing DMARD monotherapy alone. Biologic 
therapy should be used in combination with MTX over biologic monotherapy, when possible, due to superior efficacy. 
 For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite any of the above DMARD or biologic therapies, the panel 
conditionally recommends adding low-dose glucocorticoids (defined as ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent). 
Low-dose glucocorticoids may also be used in patients who need a bridge until realizing the benefits of DMARD 
therapy. The risk/benefit ratio of glucocorticoid therapy is favorable as long as the dose is low, and the duration of 
therapy is short. 
 For patients experiencing a flare of RA, the panel conditionally recommends adding short-term glucocorticoids (< 3 
months of treatment) at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible duration, to provide a favorable benefit-risk 
ratio for the patient. 
 
Recommendations for Established RA Patients 
 The panel strongly recommends using a treat-to-target strategy rather than a non-targeted approach, regardless of 
disease activity level. The ideal target should be low disease activity or remission, as determined by the clinician and 
the patient. In some cases, however, another target may be chosen because tolerance by patients or comorbidities 
may mitigate the usual choices.  
 For DMARD-naïve patients with low disease activity, the panel strongly recommends using DMARD monotherapy 
over a TNFi. For DMARD-naïve patients with moderate or high disease activity, the panel conditionally recommends 
DMARD monotherapy over double or triple DMARD therapy and DMARD monotherapy over tofacitinib. In general, 
MTX should be the preferred initial therapy for most patients with established RA with active disease. 
 For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite DMARD monotherapy including methotrexate, the panel 
strongly recommends using combination DMARDs or adding a TNFi or a non-TNF biologic or tofacitinib (all choices 
with or without methotrexate) in no particular order of preference, rather than continuing DMARD monotherapy alone. 
Biologic therapy should be used in combination with MTX over biologic monotherapy, when possible, due to its 
superior efficacy. 
 
For All Scenarios for Established RA Below, Treatment May Be With or Without MTX 
 For moderate or high disease activity despite TNFi therapy in patients currently not on a DMARD, the panel strongly 
recommends that one or two DMARDs be added to TNFi therapy rather than continuing TNFi therapy alone.  
 If disease activity is moderate or high despite single TNFi biologic therapy, the panel conditionally recommends using 
a non-TNF biologic.  
 If disease activity is moderate or high despite non-TNF biologic therapy, the panel conditionally recommends using 
another non-TNF biologic. However, if a patient has failed multiple non-TNF biologics and they are TNFi-naïve with 
moderate or high disease activity, the panel conditionally recommends treatment with a TNFi. 
 For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite prior treatment with at least one TNFi and at least one non-
TNF-biologic (sequentially, not combined), the panel conditionally recommends first treating with another non-TNF 
biologic. However, when a non-TNF biologic is not an option (e.g., patient declines non-TNF biologic therapy due to 
inefficacy or side effects), the panel conditionally recommends treatment with tofacitinib. 
 If disease activity is moderate or high despite the use of multiple (2 +) TNFi therapies (in sequence, not concurrently), 
the panel conditionally recommends non-TNF biologic therapy and then conditionally treating with tofacitinib when a 
non-TNF biologic is not an option.  
 If disease activity is moderate or high despite any of the above DMARD or biologic therapies, the panel conditionally 
recommends adding low-dose glucocorticoids.  
 If patients with established RA experience an RA flare while on DMARD, TNFi, or non-TNF biologic therapy, the panel 
conditionally recommends adding short-term glucocorticoids (< 3 months of treatment) at the lowest possible dose 
and for shortest possible duration to provide the best benefit-risk ratio for the patient. 
 In patients with established RA and low disease activity but not remission, the panel strongly recommends continuing 
DMARD therapy, TNFi, non-TNF biologic or tofacitinib rather than discontinuing respective medication.  
 In patients with established RA currently in remission, the panel conditionally recommends tapering DMARD therapy, 
TNFi, non-TNF biologic, or tofacitinib.  
 The panel strongly recommends not discontinuing all therapies in patients with established RA in disease remission. 
 
Recommendations for RA Patients With High-Risk Comorbidities 
Congestive Heart Failure 
 In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 
III or IV congestive heart failure (CHF), the panel conditionally recommends using combination DMARD therapy, a 
non-TNF biologic, or tofacitinib rather than a TNFi.

 If patients in this population are treated with a TNFi and their CHF worsens while on the TNFi, the panel conditionally 
recommends switching to combination DMARD therapy, a non-TNF biologic, or tofacitinib rather than a different TNFi. 
 
Hepatitis B 
 In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and evidence of active hepatitis B infection 
(hepatitis surface antigen positive > 6 months), who are receiving or have received effective antiviral treatment, the 
panel strongly recommends treating them the same as patients without this condition.  
 For a patient with natural immunity from prior exposure to hepatitis B (i.e., HB core antibody and HBS antibody 
positive and normal liver function tests), the panel recommends the same therapies as those without such findings as 
long as the patient’s viral load is monitored.  
 For patients with chronic hepatitis B who are untreated, referral for antiviral therapy is appropriate prior to 
immunosuppressive therapy. 
 
Hepatitis C 
 In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and evidence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection, who are receiving or have received effective antiviral treatment, the panel conditionally recommends treating 
them the same as the patients without this condition.  
 The panel recommends that rheumatologists work with gastroenterologists and/or hepatologists who would monitor 
patients and reassess the appropriateness of antiviral therapy. This is important considering the recent availability of 
highly effective therapy for HCV, which may lead to a greater number of HCV patients being treated successfully.  
 If the same patient is not requiring or receiving antiviral treatment for their hepatitis C, the panel conditionally 
recommends using DMARD therapy rather than TNFi. 
 
Malignancy 
 Previous Melanoma and Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer: 
o In patients with established RA and moderate or high disease activity and a history of previously treated or 
untreated skin cancer (melanoma or non-melanoma), the panel conditionally recommends the use of DMARD 
therapy over biologics or tofacitinib.  
 Previous Lymphoproliferative Disorders: 
o In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and a history of a previously treated 
lymphoproliferative disorder, the panel strongly recommends using rituximab rather than a TNFi and conditionally 
recommends using combination DMARD therapy, abatacept or tocilizumab rather than TNFi.  
 Previous Solid Organ Cancer: 
o In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and previously treated solid organ cancer, 
the panel conditionally recommends that they be treated for RA just as one would treat an RA patient without a 
history of solid organ cancer. 
 
Serious Infections 
In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and previous serious infection(s), the panel 
conditionally recommends using combination DMARD therapy or abatacept rather than TNFi. 
 
In 2021, the American College of Rheumatology published an update to their guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis and included several new topics, including recommendations for administration of methotrexate, use of 
methotrexate in patients with subcutaneous nodules, pulmonary disease, and NAFLD, use of rituximab in patients with 
hypogammaglobulinemia, and treatment of RA in patients with NTM lung disease.
78 Areas covered in the 2015 guidelines 
that are not covered in this update include recommendations for patients with hepatitis C and solid malignancies. 
 
The recommendations related to bDMARDs [TNF inhibitors (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab 
pegol), T cell costimulatory inhibitor (abatacept), IL-6 receptor inhibitors (tocilizumab, sarilumab), anti-CD20 antibody 
(rituximab)] are: 
 Methotrexate monotherapy is strongly recommended over bDMARD or tsDMARD monotherapy for DMARD-naive 
patients with moderate-to-high disease activity. 
 Methotrexate monotherapy is strongly recommended over methotrexate plus a non–TNF inhibitor bDMARD or 
tsDMARD for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity. 
 Methotrexate monotherapy is conditionally recommended over the combination of methotrexate plus a bDMARD or 
tsDMARD. 
 A treat-to-target approach is strongly recommended over usual care for patients who have not been previously treated 
with bDMARDs or tsDMARDs.

 A treat-to-target approach is conditionally recommended over usual care for patients who have had an inadequate 
response to bDMARDs or tsDMARDs. 
 Addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD is conditionally recommended over triple therapy (i.e., addition of sulfasalazine 
and hydroxychloroquine) for patients taking maximally tolerated doses of methotrexate who are not at target. 
 Switching to a bDMARD or tsDMARD of a different class is conditionally recommended over switching to a bDMARD 
or tsDMARD belonging to the same class for patients taking a bDMARD or tsDMARD who are not at target. 
 Gradual discontinuation of methotrexate is conditionally recommended over gradual discontinuation of the bDMARD 
or tsDMARD for patients taking methotrexate plus a bDMARD or tsDMARD who wish to discontinue a DMARD. 
 
Heart Failure 
 Addition of a non–TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD is conditionally recommended over addition of a TNF inhibitor 
for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure and an inadequate response to 
csDMARDs Switching to a non–TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD is conditionally recommended over continuation 
of a TNF inhibitor for patients taking a TNF inhibitor who develop heart failure. 
 
Hepatitis B Infection  
 Prophylactic antiviral therapy is strongly recommended over frequent monitoring of viral load and liver enzymes alone 
for patients initiating rituximab who are hepatitis B core antibody positive (regardless of hepatitis B surface antigen 
status) Prophylactic antiviral therapy is strongly recommended over frequent monitoring alone for patients initiating 
any bDMARD or tsDMARD who are hepatitis B core antibody positive and hepatitis B surface antigen positive. 
 Frequent monitoring alone of viral load and liver enzymes is conditionally recommended over prophylactic antiviral 
therapy for patients initiating a bDMARD other than rituximab or a tsDMARD who are hepatitis B core antibody 
positive and hepatitis B surface antigen negative. 
 
Persistent Hypogammaglobulinemia Without Infection  
 In the setting of persistent hypogammaglobulinemia without infection, continuation of rituximab therapy for patients at 
target is conditionally recommended over switching to a different bDMARD or tsDMARD. 
 
Previous Serious Infection  
 Addition of csDMARDs is conditionally recommended over addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients with a 
serious infection within the previous 12 months who have moderate-to-high disease activity despite csDMARD 
monotherapy. 
 
Nontuberculous Mycobacterial (NTM) Lung Disease 
 Addition of csDMARDs is conditionally recommended over addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients with NTM 
lung disease who have moderate-to-high disease activity despite csDMARD monotherapy. 
 Abatacept is conditionally recommended over other bDMARDs and tsDMARDs for patients with NTM lung disease 
who have moderate-to high disease activity despite csDMARDs. 
 
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 
The 2011 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Recommendations for the Treatment of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 
include the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, and do not differentiate between the 
agents.
34, 66 
 
For JIA patients with history of arthritis of 4 or fewer joints: 
 Initiation of a TNF inhibitor was recommended for patients who have received glucocorticoids joint injections and 3 
months of methotrexate at the maximum tolerated typical dose and have moderate or high disease activity and 
features of poor prognosis (level C). 
 Initiation of a TNF inhibitor was also recommended for patients who have received glucocorticoids joint injections and 
6 months of methotrexate and have high disease activity without features of poor prognosis (level C). 
 Initiation of a TNF inhibitor was recommended for patients specifically with the enthesitis-related arthritis category of 
JIA who have received glucocorticoids joint injections and an adequate trial of sulfasalazine (without prior 
methotrexate) and have moderate or high disease activity, irrespective of prognostic features (level C).

For JIA patients with history of arthritis of 5 or more joints: 
 Initiation of a TNF inhibitor was recommended for patients who have received methotrexate or leflunomide for 3 
months at the maximum tolerated typical dose and have moderate or high disease activity, irrespective of poor 
prognostic features (level B). 
 Initiation of a TNF inhibitor was also recommended for patients who have received methotrexate or leflunomide for 6 
months and have low disease activity, irrespective of poor prognostic features (level B). 
 Switching from one TNF inhibitor to another was recommended as one treatment approach for patients who have 
received the current TNF inhibitor for 4 months and have moderate or high disease activity, irrespective of poor 
prognostic features (level C).  
 Switching to a TNF inhibitor was recommended as one treatment approach for patients who have received abatacept 
for 3 months and have high disease activity and features of poor prognosis and for patients who have received 
abatacept for 6 months and have moderate or high disease activity, irrespective of prognostic features (level D). 
 
Level of evidence “B” was assigned when the recommendation was supported by nonrandomized controlled studies (e.g., 
cohort and case–control studies) or extrapolations from randomized clinical trials. 
 
Level of evidence “C” was assigned when the recommendation was supported by uncontrolled studies (case series), 
extrapolations from nonrandomized controlled studies, or marked extrapolations from randomized clinical trials (e.g., 
studies of adult arthritis patients applied to juvenile arthritis or studies of polyarthritis phenotype applied to oligoarthritis). 
 
In 2019, the ACR published additional guidelines for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis manifesting as non-
systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, or enthesitis.
79 Recommendations including the use of TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, 
etanercept, infliximab, golimumab) and non-TNF inhibitors (abatacept, tocilizumab, rituximab) are summarized below: 
 
Polyarthritis 
 In children and adolescents with JIA and polyarthritis initiating treatment with a biologic (etanercept, adalimumab, 
golimumab, abatacept, or tocilizumab) combination therapy with a DMARD is conditionally recommended over 
biologic monotherapy (Very low level of evidence). 
 Combination therapy with a DMARD is strongly recommended for infliximab (Low level of evidence). 
 Initial therapy. 
o In patients without risk factors, a DMARD is conditionally recommended over a biologic (Low level of evidence). 
o In patients with risk factors, a DMARD is conditionally recommended over a biologic, recognizing that there are 
situations where initial therapy that includes a biologic may be preferred (Low level of evidence).  
 Initial biologic therapy may be considered for patients with risk factors and involvement of high-risk joints 
(e.g., cervical spine, wrist, or hip), high disease activity, and/or those judged by their physician to be at high 
risk of disabling joint damage. 
 Subsequent therapy: Low disease activity (cJADAS-10 ≤ 2.5 and ≥ 1 active joint). 
o For children receiving a DMARD and/or biologic, escalating therapy is conditionally recommended over no 
escalation of therapy. Escalation of therapy may include: Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection(s), optimization of 
DMARD dose, trial of methotrexate if not done, and adding or changing biologic. (Very low level of evidence). 
 Subsequent therapy: Moderate/high disease activity (cJADAS-10 > 2.5). 
o If patient is receiving DMARD monotherapy: 
 Adding a biologic to original DMARD is conditionally recommended over changing to a second DMARD (Low 
level of evidence). 
 Adding a biologic is conditionally recommended over changing to triple DMARD therapy (Low level of 
evidence). 
o If patient is receiving first TNFi (±DMARD): 
 Switching to a non-TNFi biologic (tocilizumab or abatacept) is conditionally recommended over switching to a 
second TNFi. 
 A second TNFi may be appropriate for patients with good initial response to their first TNFi (Very low level of 
evidence). 
o If patient is receiving second biologic: 
 Using TNFi, abatacept, or tocilizumab (depending on prior biologics received) is conditionally recommended 
over rituximab (Very low level of evidence). 
 
Sacroiliitis 
 In children and adolescents with active sacroiliitis despite treatment with NSAIDs:  
o Adding TNFi is strongly recommended over continued NSAID monotherapy (Low level of evidence).

Enthesitis 
 In children and adolescents with active enthesitis despite treatment with NSAIDs: 
o Using a TNFi is conditionally recommended over methotrexate or sulfasalazine (Low level of evidence). 
 
A strong recommendation means that the Voting Panel was confident that the desirable effects of following the 
recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects (or vice versa), so the course of action would apply to all or almost all 
patients, and only a small proportion would not want to follow the recommendation. In some cases, strong 
recommendations were made even in the absence of moderate- or high-quality evidence based on Voting Panel 
experience and data from adult studies. 
 
A conditional recommendation means that the Voting Panel believed that the desirable effects of following the 
recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the 
patients, but some may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are 
particularly preference-sensitive and warrant a shared decision-making approach. Conditional recommendations were 
generally based on low- to very low–quality evidence. 
 
In 2021, the ACR published additional guidelines for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis manifesting as 
oligoarthritis, TMJ arthritis, and systemic JIA with and without macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).
80 
Recommendations including the use of TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab 
pegol) and other biologic response modifiers (abatacept, tocilizumab, anakinra, canakinumab) are summarized below: 
 
Oligoarticular JIA 
 Biologic DMARDs are strongly recommended if there is inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or 
intraarticular glucocorticoids (IAGCs) and at least 1 conventional synthetic DMARD (Very low certainty of evidence). 
 
TMJ Arthritis 
 Biologic DMARDs are conditionally recommended if there is inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or 
intraarticular glucocorticoids (IAGCs) and at least 1 conventional synthetic DMARD (Very low certainty of evidence). 
 
Systemic JIA Without Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) 
 Biologic DMARDs (IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors) are conditionally recommended as initial monotherapy (Very low certainty 
of evidence). 
 IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are strongly recommended over a single or combination of conventional synthetic DMARDs for 
inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or glucocorticoids (Very low certainty of evidence). 
 Biologic DMARDs or conventional synthetic DMARDs are strongly recommended over long-term glucocorticoids for 
residual arthritis and incomplete response to IL-1 and/or IL-6 inhibitors (Very low certainty of evidence). 
 
Systemic JIA with MAS 
 IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are conditionally recommended over calcineurin inhibitors alone to achieve inactive disease 
and resolution of MAS. (Very low certainty of evidence). 
 Biologic DMARDs or conventional synthetic DMARDs are strongly recommended over long-term glucocorticoids for 
residual arthritis and incomplete response to IL-1 and/or IL-6 inhibitors(Very low certainty of evidence). 
 
Noninfectious Uveitis 
In 2014, a subcommittee of the Executive Committee of the American Uveitis Society conducted a systematic review of 
published literature and developed a guideline for the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) biologic agents in 
patients with ocular inflammatory disorders. There recommendations are as follows: 
 Strong recommendation. Anti-TNF therapy with infliximab (good-quality evidence) or adalimumab (moderate-quality 
evidence) should be considered early in management of patients with vision threatening ocular manifestations of 
Behçet’s disease. 
 Strong recommendation. Anti-TNF therapy with infliximab (good-quality evidence) or adalimumab (good-quality 
evidence) should be considered as second-line immunomodulatory therapy for children with vision-threatening uveitis 
secondary to JIA in whom methotrexate therapy is insufficiently effective or not tolerated. Methotrexate therapy, if 
tolerated, may be combined with infliximab therapy. 
 Strong recommendation. Anti-TNF therapy with infliximab or potentially adalimumab should be considered as second-
line immunomodulatory therapy in patients with vision-threatening chronic uveitis from seronegative 
spondyloarthropathy (good- to moderate-quality evidence).

 Discretionary recommendation. Anti-TNF therapy with infliximab or adalimumab for other forms of ocular 
inflammation, including sarcoidosis, scleritis, and panuveitis, may be considered in patients with vision-threatening, 
corticosteroid-dependent disease who have failed first-line immunomodulatory therapies such as antimetabolites or 
calcineurin inhibitors (moderate-quality evidence). The literature for adalimumab is less developed than for infliximab, 
but these agents seem to show similar efficacy in most studies. Until more comparative data are available, no 
recommendation can be made as to preferred agent, although numerous studies have suggested that adalimumab 
may be effective in patients who have become intolerant to or have developed reduced clinical responsiveness to 
infliximab. 
 Strong recommendation. Use of infliximab or adalimumab should be considered before etanercept therapy for 
treatment of ocular inflammatory disease. Etanercept may have efficacy for treatment of some forms of ocular 
inflammatory disease such as mucocutaneous Behçet’s disease, but it has been associated with development of 
uveitis in JIA patients and development of sarcoid-like disease in others. Patients presently taking etanercept for other 
indications with existing, incompletely controlled uveitis or new ocular inflammatory disease should consider switching 
to infliximab or adalimumab if possible. 
 
Technology Assessments 
A 2020 Cochrane review was published to compare the efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents, small 
molecules, and biologics for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.
24 The technical assessment also sought to 
provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety. The assessment included 140 studies (31 
new studies for the update) in the review (51,749 randomized participants, 68% men, mainly recruited from hospitals). 
Nineteen treatments were assessed. At class level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti‐IL17, anti‐
IL12/23, anti‐IL23, and anti‐TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional 
systemic agents. At drug level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, infliximab, all of the anti‐IL17 drugs (ixekizumab, 
secukinumab, bimekizumab, and brodalumab) and the anti‐IL23 drugs (risankizumab and guselkumab, but not 
tildrakizumab) were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than ustekinumab and 3 anti‐TNF alpha agents: 
adalimumab, certolizumab and etanercept. Adalimumab and ustekinumab were significantly more effective in reaching 
PASI 90 than certolizumab and etanercept. There was no significant difference between tofacitinib or apremilast and 
between two conventional drugs: ciclosporin and methotrexate. The network meta‐analysis also showed that infliximab, 
ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, guselkumab, secukinumab and brodalumab outperformed other drugs when 
compared to placebo in reaching PASI 90. The authors review showed that compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, 
ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, guselkumab, secukinumab, and brodalumab were the best choices for achieving 
PASI 90 in people with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence (low‐certainty 
evidence for bimekizumab).

The FDA issued an alert dated September 7, 2011, to inform healthcare professionals that the Boxed Warning for the 
entire class of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFα) blockers has been updated to include the risk of infection from two 
bacterial pathogens, Legionella and Listeria. In addition, the Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions sections of 
the labels for all of the TNFα blockers have been revised so that they contain consistent information about the risk for 
serious infections and the associated disease-causing pathogens.11 
 
The FDA issued an update on November 3, 2011 regarding their ongoing safety review of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) 
blockers and malignancy in children, adolescents, and young adults (30 years of age or younger). This issue was 
previously communicated in June 2008, August 2009, and April 2011. The FDA is requiring the manufacturers of TNF 
blockers to perform enhanced safety surveillance for these products. The manufacturers will also provide FDA with annual 
summaries and assessments of malignancies and TNF blocker utilization data. Healthcare professionals should remain 
vigilant for cases of malignancy in patients treated with TNF blockers.

Instructions for Use 
 
This Medical Benefit Drug Policy provides assistance in interpreting UnitedHealthcare standard benefit plans. When 
deciding coverage, the member specific benefit plan document must be referenced as the terms of the member specific 
benefit plan may differ from the standard plan. In the event of a conflict, the member specific benefit plan document 
governs. Before using this policy, please check the member specific benefit plan document and any applicable federal or 
state mandates. UnitedHealthcare reserves the right to modify its Policies and Guidelines as necessary. This Medical 
Benefit Drug Policy is provided for informational purposes. It does not constitute medical advice. 
 
This Medical Benefit Drug Policy may also be applied to Medicare Advantage plans in certain instances. In the absence of 
a Medicare National Coverage Determination (NCD), Local Coverage Determination (LCD), or other Medicare coverage 
guidance, CMS allows a Medicare Advantage Organization (MAO) to create its own coverage determinations, using 
objective evidence-based rationale relying on authoritative evidence (Medicare IOM Pub. No. 100-16, Ch. 4, §90.5). 
 
UnitedHealthcare may also use tools developed by third parties, such as the InterQual® criteria, to assist us in 
administering health benefits. UnitedHealthcare Medical Benefit Drug Policies are intended to be used in connection with 
the independent professional medical judgment of a qualified health care provider and do not constitute the practice of 
medicine or medical advice.
