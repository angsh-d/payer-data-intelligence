INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
The following Coverage Policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. 
Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients 
and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and 
coverage determinations do not apply to those clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide 
guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Please 
note, the terms of a customer’s particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, 
Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan 
document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage 
Policies are based. For example, a customer’s benefit plan document may contain a specific 
exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer’s 
benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence 
of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the 
terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance 
require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date 
of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including 
Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request 
should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment 
where appropriate and have discretion in making individual coverage determinations. Where 
coverage for care or services does not depend on specific circumstances, reimbursement will only 
be provided if a requested service(s) is submitted in accordance with the relevant criteria outlined 
in the applicable Coverage Policy, including covered diagnosis and/or procedure code(s). 
Reimbursement is not allowed for services when billed for conditions or diagnoses that are not 
covered under this Coverage Policy (see “Coding Information” below). When billing, providers 
must use the most appropriate codes as of the effective date of the submission. Claims submitted 
for services that are not accompanied by covered code(s) under the applicable Coverage Policy

will be denied as not covered. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health 
benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used 
as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support 
medical necessity and other coverage determinations. 
 
OVERVIEW 
Infliximab products are tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) approved for the following 
indications:1-3 
• Ankylosing spondylitis, for reducing signs and symptoms of active disease. 
• Crohn’s disease, for the following uses: 
o Reducing the signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in 
patients ≥ 6 years of age  with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have 
had an inadequate response to conventional therapy; AND 
o Reducing the number of draining enterocutaneous and rectovaginal fistulas and 
maintaining fistula closure in adults with fistulizing Crohn’s disease. 
• Plaque psoriasis , for treatment of adults with chronic severe (i.e., extensive and/or 
disabling) disease who are candidates for systemic therapy and when other systemic 
therapies are less appropriate. 
• Psoriatic arthritis , for reducing signs and symptoms of active arthritis, inhibiting the 
progression of structural damage and improving physical function. 
• Rheumatoid arthritis, in combination with methotrexate for reducing signs and symptoms, 
inhibiting the progression of structural damage and improving physical function in patients 
with moderately to severely active disease. 
• Ulcerative colitis, for the following uses: 
o Reducing signs and symptoms, inducing and maintaining clinical remission and mucosal 
healing, and eliminating corticosteroid use in adults with moderately to severely active 
disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy; AND 
o Reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients 
≥ 6 years of age with moderately to severely active disease who have had an inadequate 
response to conventional therapy. 
 
Avsola,
 Inflectra, and Renflexis were approved as biosimilar to Remicade, indicating no clinically 
meaningful differences in safety and effectiveness and the same mechanism of action, route of 
administration, dosage form, and strength as Remicade.2-3  However, minor differences in clinically 
inactive components are allowed.  At this time, only biosimilarity has been demonstrated (not 
interchangeability). 
 
Guidelines 
TNFis feature prominently in guidelines for treatment of many inflammatory conditions. 
• Ankylosing Spondylitis and Non -Radiographic Spondyloarthritis:   Guidelines for 
ankylosing spondylitis and non -radiographic axial spondyloarthritis are published by the 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of 
America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (2019). 4  Following primary 
nonresponse to a TNFi, an interleukin (IL) -17 blocker is recommended; however, if the 
patient is a secondary nonresponder, a second TNFi is recommended over switching out of 
the class.  In pati ents with a contraindication to a TNFi, use of an IL -17 blocker is 
recommended over traditional oral agents such as methotrexate or sulfasalazine. 
• Crohn’s Disease:  The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) [2025] has guidelines 
for the management of CD in adults. 5  In moderate to severe disease, systemic 
corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized for induction of remission.  Advanced 
therapies recommended include tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, Entyvio ® 
(vedolizumab), interleukin (IL) -23 inhibitors, IL -12/23 inhibitors, and Rinvoq ®

(upadacitinib).  If steroids are utilized for induction, efforts should be made to introduce 
steroid-sparing agents for maintenance therapy.  Guidelines from the American 
Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [2021] include infliximab among the therapies f or 
moderate to severe Crohn’s disease, for induction and maintenance of remission.6 
• Plaque Psoriasis:  Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists (AAD) and 
National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) [2019] recommend infliximab as a monotherapy 
treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 
• Psoriatic Arthritis:  Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for 
use in treatment -naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis, and in those who were previously 
treated with an oral therapy.8 
• Rheumatoid Arthritis:  Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a 
targeted synthetic disease modifying anti -rheumatic drug (DMARD) for a patient taking the 
maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.9 
• Ulcerative Colitis:  The AGA (2024) and the ACG (2025) have clinical practice guidelines 
on the management of moderate to severe UC.10,11  In moderate to severe disease, systemic 
corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized for induction of remission.  Advanced 
therapies recommended include TNF inhibitors, Entyvio, IL-23 inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.  If 
steroids are utilized for induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-sparing agents 
for maintenance therapy.  Of note, guidelines state corticosteroids may be avoided entirely 
when other effective induction strategies are planned. 11  Both guidelines also recommend 
that any drug that effectively treats induction should be continued for maintenance.10,11 
• Behcet’s Disease:  The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations 
(2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight -threatening uveitis. 13  For patients 
refractory to first -line treatments (e.g., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment 
options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory 
gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement.  Recommendations for the 
use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the American Academy of Ophthalmology 
(AAO) [2014] note that TNFis may be used first- line in patients with ophthalmic 
manifestations of Behcet’s disease and for acute exacerbations of pre -existing Behcet’s 
disease.14 
• Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD):   Guidelines for hematopoietic cell transplantation 
from the National Comprehensive Cancer network (NCCN) [version 2.2025 – June 3, 2025] 
list infliximab among the agents used for steroid-refractory acute GVHD.15  For patients with 
steroid-refractory acute GVHD, Jakafi ® (ruxolitinib tablets) is the only category 1 
recommended agent.  Other alternative agents recommended by NCCN for acute GVHD 
(category 2A) include the following:  alemtuzumab IV infusion, alpha -1 antitrypsin, anti-
thymocyte globulin, Simulect ® (basiliximab), calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, 
cyclosporine), Enbrel® (etanercept), extracorporeal photopheresis, infliximab, mammalian 
target of rapamycin inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus), mycophenolate mofetil, Nipent ™  
(pentostatin), tocilizumab, urinary-derived human chorionic gonadotropin/epidermal growth 
factor, and Entyvio® (vedolizumab)..15 
• Hidradenitis Suppurativa:  Guidelines from the US and Canadian Hidradenitis Suppurativa 
Foundations make recommendations for topical, intralesional, and systemic medical 
management of disease.16  For acute lesions of all stages, antiseptic washes, short-term oral 
steroids, and interlesional steroids are among the recommendations.  Systemic antibiotics 
have been a mainstay of treatment.  Infliximab is a recommended therapy for moderate to 
severe disease. 
• Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities Associated with Checkpoint Inhibitors:   NCCN 
has guidelines (version 1.2025 – December 20, 2024) for Management of Immunotherapy -
Related Toxicities.17  Infliximab is recommended among the alternatives to manage steroid-
refractory toxicities related to immune checkpoint inhibitors including inflammatory arthritis,

Coverage Policy Number: IP0660 
uveitis, hemolytic anemia, myocarditis, stage 3 acute kidney injury/elevated serum 
creatinine, pneumonitis, esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis, and diarrhea/colitis.  Additionally, 
the guidelines also note that infliximab has not been tested and is not rec ommended for 
hepatotoxicity due to concerns of liver toxicity.   
• Indeterminate Colitis:  Infliximab has been effective in some patients with refractory 
indeterminate colitis (retrospective reviews). 18,19  When patients who are refractory to 
standard therapy can be definitively classified as having ulcerative colitis, colectomy is 
considered an effective long -term surgical treatment.  Patient’s with Crohn’s disease; 
however, have a high risk of complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and are treated 
more aggressively with medical interventions since surgical options cannot offer the same 
likelihood of success as in ulcerative colitis. 
• Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA):   There are guidelines from ACR and the Arthritis 
Foundation for the treatment of JIA (2021) which address oligoarthritis and 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis. 20  For oligoarthritis, a biologic is recommended 
following a trial of a conventional synthetic DMARD.  In patients with TMJ arthritis, scheduled 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or intra -articular glucocorticoids are 
recommended first-line.  A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response 
or intolerance.  Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic ± conventional synthetic DMARD 
(methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of 
TMJ arthritis.  In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated 
for JIA.  The ACR/Arthritis Foundation Guideline for the treatment of JIA (2019) provides 
updated recommendations for juvenile non -
systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and 
enthesitis.21  Infliximab is among the TN Fis recommended as subsequent therapy following 
treatment with a conventional synthetic DMARD such as methotrexate.  TNF antagonists 
such as infliximab may also be used as second- or third-line treatment for systemic JIA.22 
• Ocular Inflammatory Disorders:   Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular 
inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that infliximab may be used as second-
line corticosteroid-sparing therapy for chronic and severe scleritis.14  Infliximab may be used 
in patients with uveitis due to various causes (e.g., spondyloarthropathy -associated or 
human leukocyte antigen [HLA] -B27-associated uveitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis -
associated uveitis, and other posterior uveitides and panuv eitis syndromes).  I nfliximab 
should be considered second -line in vision -threatening JIA -associated uveitis when 
methotrexate has failed or is not tolerated (strong recommendation) and vision-threatening 
chronic uveitis from seronegative spondyloarthropathy (strong recommendation).  Infliximab 
may also be considered in other patients who have vision -threatening or corticosteroid -
dependent disease who have failed first-line therapies.  The recommendations point out that 
studies evaluating infliximab in uveitis included patients with birdshot chorioretinitis (BSCR), 
a bilateral posterior uveitis generally treated with systemic immunomodulation; these 
patients showed a good response to infliximab. 
• Pyoderma Gangrenosum:   Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and 
systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum.  Oral prednisone is the most 
common initial immunosuppressant medication. 23  Other systemic therapies include 
cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and 
TNFis (i.e., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products).  In case reports, TNFis have 
been effective. 
• Sarcoidosis:  The European Respiratory Society Task Force has guidelines for treatment of 
pulmonary, cutaneous, cardiac, and neurologic sarcoidosis. 24  Infliximab is a recommended 
therapy after continued disease or relapse while taking systemic corticosteroids and 
immunosuppressants (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, mycophenolate 
mofetil, hydroxychloroquine). 
• Still’s Disease:  Still’s disease presents in adults with features similar to those of systemic 
onset JIA.25,26  In case series, infliximab has been effective in patients with Still’s disease

that was refractory to therapy with corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, and 
cyclophosphamide.24 
 
Dosing Information 
The recommended dose of infliximab intravenous is weight-based and varies slightly by indication.1-
3  Dosing increase, interval shortening, or changing to another therapy is generally recommended 
for attenuation of response.  Thus, published recommendations note that the dose and interval of 
infliximab may be adjusted, as needed, in patients who initially respond but then lose that 
response.
2  Additionally, data are emerging concerning tapering of infliximab dosage in patients 
with inflammatory conditions who are in remission or have low disease activity.  When the dose of 
any RA therapy is tapered, it is recommended that there be a comprehensive plan to monitor disease 
activity and address possible flares. 
 
Coverage Policy 
 
POLICY STATEMENT 
Prior Authorization is required for benefit coverage of infliximab products.  Approval is 
recommended for those who meet the Criteria and Dosing for the listed indications.  Extended 
approvals are allowed if the patient continues to meet the Criteria and Dosing.  Requests for doses 
outside of the established dosing documented in this policy will be considered on a case-by-case 
basis by a clinician (i.e., Medical Director or Pharmacist).  All approvals are provided for the 
duration noted below.  In cases where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 
30 days.  Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of a patient 
treated with infliximab products as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long -
term efficacy, initial approval requires infliximab products to be prescribed by or in consultation 
with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated. 
 
NOTE: This product also requires the use of preferred products before approval of a  
requested non-preferred infliximab intravenous product. Refer to the respective 
Inflammatory Conditions – Infliximab Intravenous Products Preferred Specialty 
Management Policy (PSM005) for additional preferred product criteria requirements and 
exceptions.

clinical response from baseline (prior to initiating an infliximab product); OR 
Note:  Examples of objective measures include best-corrected visual acuity, 
assessment of chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, or anterior 
chamber cell grade or vitreous haze grade. 
b) Compared with baseline (prior to initiating an infliximab product), patient 
experienced an improvement in at least one symptom, such as decreased eye pain, 
redness, light sensitivity, and/or blurred vision; or improvement in visual acuity. 
 
Dosing.  Approve ONE of the following regimens (A or B): 
A) Initial Therapy.  Approve up to 10 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 
similar doses at 2 and 6 weeks after the first infusion, then no more frequently than once 
every 4 weeks thereafter. 
B) Patient is Currently Receiving an Infliximab Product.  Approve up to a maximum dose of 10 
mg/kg administered intravenously no more frequently than once every 4 weeks. 
 
 
 
Conditions Not Covered 
 
Infliximab intravenous products for any other use are considered not medically 
necessary, including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be 
updated as new published data are available):  
 
 
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small Molecule Drug.  
This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a 
targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix  
for examples).  Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher 
rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. 
Note:  This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drug (e.g., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with 
this medication.

patient has tried at least one conventional systemic 
treatment to at least one systemic medication.  
Jakafi (ruxolitinib), Simulect (basiliximab), an 
etanercept product, sirolimus, Nipent (pentostatin), 
a tocilizumab product, and Entyvio (vedolizumab) 
were added to the Note of examples of systemic 
medications. 
Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities Associated 
with Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy:   
“According to the prescriber” was added to the 
requirement that patient experienced an 
immunotherapy-related toxicity while receiving a 
checkpoint inhibitor and specific examples of 
immunotherapy-related toxicities were removed.  
Cardiologist, hematologist, nephrologist, and 
pulmonologist were added as accepted specialists 
to the specialist requirement.   
Early Annual 
Revision 
Plaque Psoriasis:  For initial therapy, in the Note, 
a 3-month trial or prior intolerance to Otezla/Otezla 
XR (apremilast tablets/extended-release tablets), or 
Sotyktu (deucravacitinib tablets) was added as an 
exception to the requirement for a trial of one 
traditional systemic agent for psoriasis.  For initial 
therapy, the requirement “patient has a 
contraindication to methotrexate, as determined by 
the prescriber” was modified to “according to the 
prescriber, the patient has a contraindication to 
methotrexate”.  In the Appendix, Otezla XR 
(apremilast extended-release tablets) was added 
under the Oral Therapies/Targeted Synthetic Oral 
Small Molecular Drugs.
