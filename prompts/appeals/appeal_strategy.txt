## Instructions

If the policy document is marked as unavailable or contains placeholder text (e.g., "[Policy document not available...]"), base your analysis on the denial reason and general clinical guidelines. Do NOT fabricate specific policy section references or quote policy text that was not provided.

Analyze the denial and develop a comprehensive appeal strategy. For each recommendation, cite the specific policy section, clinical guideline, or evidence that supports the appeal argument.
